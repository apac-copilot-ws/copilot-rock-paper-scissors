# GitHub Copilot Workshop in a Box

ℹ️ For GitHub Workshop organizers, you can follow these [supporting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lUqyYQk0vzJB0YjmNWIoOw0EKdDpj8jQ_mkCRJAMuOQ/edit#slide=id.g23749255e47_0_0) for the workshop.


## Build a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game from Scratch with GitHub Copilot

In this fun workshop, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot to build a simple game in Python, with little to no coding experience required.

Participants will be guided to install the GitHub Copilot VS Code extension, follow a CodeTour to learn how to interact with GitHub Copilot, and then use GitHub Copilot to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game from scratch. 

Depending on the time available, participants will be able to complete the game or just get started, from a simple version all the way to introducing additional logic to make the game more interesting complete, with unit tests and REST API endpoints.

Estimated time to complete: `10 to 60 minutes`

## Instructions for Workshop Organizers

We recommend having a GitHub Solutions Engineer or workshop organizer be present at all times to help out during the hands-on experience, and to ensure participants sign up ahead of the session and that a trial is enabled for all participants (you may request support from your GitHub Sales representatitive) or via Copilot for Individuals or Business licenses. 

# Setup

For best results, we recommend participants to use Codespaces with the CodeTour extension installed (provided in this repository's devcontainer.json file). 

[**GitHub Codespaces**](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code in the cloud from your browser and comes with included allowances for personal and Enterprise accounts. You can check under your [billing settings page](https://github.com/settings/billing) to verify if you have enough allowance to use a Codespace.

> Alternatively, **VS Code** can be used locally with the CodeTour extension installed.

In order to use GitHub Copilot, you will need to have a GitHub account and be logged in to GitHub.com. 

We recommend each participant makes a copy of this repository to their own GitHub account or within the trial organization created for the workshop.

## Project Structure

In this project you will find: 

* a `main.py` file with no contents
* a devcontainer that installs CodeTour and GitHub Copilot when the Codespace is created
* an instructions folder containing a CodeTour to guide the developer through using GitHub Copilot or a file with step by step to instuctions if you don't want to use CodeTour. 

## To complete this tutorial, you will need:
* Access to [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
* A copy of this repository
* Codespaces (batteries included!)
    *  Alternatively, VS Code with the CodeTour extension and Python 3 installed

## Getting started

Choose **either** the CodeTour or Non-CodeTour instructions below.

* **CodeTour**  (Inline instructions)
We recommend you use CodeTour to help walk you through this exercise. You can find the instructions at [using-codetour.md](./.instructions/using-codetour.md)


* **Non CodeTour** (Written step by step instructions)
You can follow the instructions available here: [stepbystep.md](./.instructions/stepbystep.md)

💡 For a more collaborative experience we recommend participants to form teams of 2 or 3 to complete the workshop and to learn from each other.

# Additional Challenges

After the CodeTour is complete, you can try the following challenges:

- Add Lizard, Spock, and other options to the game
- Add a score counter
- Add a REST API endpoint to play the game
- Add unit tests to the game
- ...

😉 Remember to have fun!

# Feedback Survey

For workshop organizers, we recommend you use the following survey to collect feedback from your participants:

- [Google Form Template](https://forms.gle/e8mg3r9RxbFsbfBy7) (please make a copy of the form to use for your workshop!)

This will help us improve the workshop and the GitHub Copilot experience and also help our customers measure the impact of Copilot on their teams.


# FAQ 

- **How do I get a GitHub Copilot license?**
  - You can request a trial license from your GitHub Sales representative or via Copilot for Individuals or Business licenses.
- **How do I get a GitHub Codespaces license?**
    - Codespaces is included with GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, and GitHub Free. You can check under your [billing settings page](https://github.com/settings/billing).
- **I am having trouble activating GitHub Copilot after I load the plugin, what should I do?**
    - This could be because you launched your Codespace before you activated GitHub Copilot or accepted the invitation to the trial org. Please try to reload your Codespace and try again.
